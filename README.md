In this project, you will write a program that incorporates the Java™ concepts you have learned throughout this unit.

Your program will include:

Use of the camelCase naming convention
Both multiline and inline comments
The print and printtln methods
Variables
Arithmetic expressions
The compound assignment operator
Conversion between int and double data types
Requirements of this project
Your program should allow any number to be stored in a variable and printed out. Then, the program should output its double, output six added to it, output that number divided in half, and, finally, output that number subtracted by the original number. In this way, the program displays each calculation, and of course, the final result of three.

No shortcuts! You know the answer to the riddle will always be three, but your program is being used to test and validate the riddle. You should print the result of all calculations, not just “3.”

Looking back at previous programs and the requirements stated above, you know you will need:

 a class definition header that matches the file name
 the main method of the program
 a variable defined as the “starting number you choose”
You may use a Scanner class
 Create six variables representing integer and double data types and positive, negative, and zero values
 an algorithm(s) that processes the chosen number
 a print statement displaying the number you chose
 a print statement displaying each calculation and the final result
 comments in your code - See Below
 use of camelCase when appropriate
 

Include the block comment below.

You will comment throughout your program and explain how your program works.
As part of your project documentation, you will take quality screenshots of your program’s code and output.
- Create six different test cases that demonstrates the correct outcome.
Positive int
Negative int
Positive double
Negative double
Zero
One
